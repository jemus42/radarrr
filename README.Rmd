The goal of `radarrr` is to get movies out of [Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr). The API is [documented here](https://radarr.video/docs/api/).

At this point, the package only provides one function: `get_movies`, which returns a `tibble` of all the movies Radarr knows about. Nothing less, nothing more, because that's the only thing I'm really interested in with the Radarr API.

## Installation

```r
remotes::install_github("jemus42/radarrr")
```

To use it, it's easiest to supply your API credentials via `~/.Renviron`, like so:

```sh
# radarr
radarr_url=http://radarr.mydomain.tld
radarr_apikey=thisisanalphanumericstring
```
